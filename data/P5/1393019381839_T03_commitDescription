In MagResReader.java:

In readTensorNew():

float f = (iType == 0 ? 0.04f : 1f); -> I have no idea what this means. 

 atom.tensors[iType].setScale(f) is changed to  atom.tensors[iType].setTypeFactor(f). 
The whole function setScale has been replace by a block of more detailed function in Tensor.java. Now, atom.tensors[iType] is
 calling setTypeFactor. setTypeFactor set the Tensor parameter typefacotr to the parameter sent through setTypeFactor (here, 'f') - and set lengths to null.
In setScale, none of this was done, they just multiply the eigenValues vector by the value sent trhough setScale (here 'f'). 

In readTensorOld(): same comment about setScale transformed into setTypeFactor

In AtomeSetCollection.java:

A variable is refactored: axes is renamed eigenVectors, and a new variable is created, an array of floats named lengths, which stores the eigen values of object t. 
The rest of the changed code is refactoring the code from axes to eigenVectors.

Finally, from Tensor.fromVectors() is refactored into
