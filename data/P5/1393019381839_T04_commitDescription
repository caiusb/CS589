The commit creates a new private static final int named R_styleable_Button_textAppearance. This new variable is assigned to zero, and used only once
when initializing int ap, using getRecourseID from obbject TypedArray.

This int ap is then checked in a if statement. If statement true, then we initalize another TypeArray object, 
check if object has been initilized and assigne a new value of mAllCaps. the new typeArray is then cleaned out of the program. 

android.R.attr.textAllCaps is changed to android.R.attr.textAppearance - I don't know this API, but I supposed this changed the way the text is displayed
Instead of being displayed in all caps, the text is display with the normal appearance?
Many things have been changed from AllCaps to textAppearance - it might just be a refactoring.
