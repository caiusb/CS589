in FreeRotator.java:
The commit added a if statement that checkes a variable useUnrotatedShape because returning a value. This boolean is also used later in this file to improve an if statement which 
checks that the getAngle() of the shape is 0.0 or that the shape is unrotated. 

in Properties.java:
They just added a bunch of blank lines to make their code more readable. 

in SpecifiedSideAccess.java:
Added 'the' in the comments.
They changed the indentation of the class SpecifiedSideAccess.

They simplified the implementation of currentPlayerHasAccess. They are diong essentially the same task but they divded it into a if statement instead of everything in the return statement, which makes it much more 
easily read.
