%Description of the experiment (what are we looking for)
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do SVN commits take more time to understand than Git commits?
	\item Does user background influence the time it takes to understand a commit?
	\item Does user background influence the quality~/~depth of understanding a commit~/~change description?
	\item Is there a common level of change description between people?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%What we did
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Experiment description}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Within subject design
	\item Each participant had to describe the changes done in 6 commits (3 SVN + 3 Git)
	\item The commit order was randomized to avoid the learning effect
	\item Commits were randomly chosen for the top projects in Sourceforge and GitHub
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%Internal threats: 
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Internal threats}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\emph{Selection:}} The different experience levels of the participants can affect the results.
	\item{\emph{Maturation:}} The participants had to describe a total of 6 commits. 
	Some reported that the tasks were getting boring after a while.
	This might affect the end results.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%External threats
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{External threats}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\emph{Commit selection:}} While the commits were selected randomly, there is a possibility that they are not representative for the general practice. 
	\item{\emph{Tool:}} For this study we build a special tool. 
	This might be different than the tools used in the wild.
